 "abstract": "The Itatinga site is a long-term experimentation (started in 2008) that focus mainly on eucalyptus plantations. Our specific objectives are:\n- To understand the biogeochemical functioning of these fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations, and in particular the coupling between water, carbon, and nutrients cycles;\n- To use this information to develop eco-physiological models simulating the growth and balance of water, carbon and mineral elements of plantations;\n- To spatialize models from ground maps, satellite images and meteorological data;\n- To evaluate the environmental impacts and sustainability of plantations (impacts on water resources, soil fertility, regional climate.\nThe experiment is located in Brazil, in the state of Sao Paulo. It is located at an average altitude of 800 m. Longitude / latitude 48°43'40.60''W / 22°58'4.50 ''S with an average annual temperature of 19.6 ° C and rainfall of the order of 1350 mm/year. The soil of the experiment is a ferralsol made of 72% sand, 15% clay, 3% silt.\nThe site equipment includes a flux tower in a clonal Eucalyptus plantation, where nutrient cycles are also monitored. It also includes clonal tests, experimental plots that aim to study the effects of partial exclusion of rainfall and potassium fertilization on the cycles of mineral elements, carbon and water, and finally experimental plots comparing the ecophysiological / biogeochemical functioning of monospecific and plurispecific plantations. This study of the impact of tree diversity on the functioning of forest ecosystems is conducted on high-growing exotic species (mixture of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium) and on native species of Mata Atlântica (biome in which is located the Itatinga site).\n\nthemes : Biogeochemistry of forest plantations, Ecological intensification of tropical forest plantations.",
