 "abstract": "The platform ‘GenoSol’ was created in 2008 by the Research Unit of INRA (National Institute for Agronomic Research) Agroecology at Dijon (France). The aim of this platform is to provide an appropriate logistic structure for the acquisition, storage and characterization of soil microbial genetic resources obtained by extensive sampling (several hundred to several thousand soils), on very large space and/or time scales, and to make these resources readily available for the whole scientific community and policy makers. The ultimate goal is to produce a reliable reference system based on molecular characterization of the soil and environmental microbial communities that provide scientific interpretations of the analyses from large scales of time and space sampling.\nGenoSol's activities are organized around 3 services:\n- a conservatory of soil genetic resources: this service is a long-term conservatory of soil samples coming from soil network survey and experimental sites, at a national (french) and international scale,\n- a technical platform for standardisation of molecular tools and characterization of microbial genetic resources (density, taxonomic diversity, activity),\n- an environmental reference system, based on MicroSol database®, mathematical and bioinformatical tools, that provides scientific and operational interpretations of molecular characterization of the soil and environmental microbial communities. \nThe plateform acquired different labels (CNOC and IBISA) for its policy of management of quality system. All the three services are available for scientific community to provide logistical and technical support for research projects.",
