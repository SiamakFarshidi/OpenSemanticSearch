 "abstract": "The site of Qualiagro is part of the French national network SOERE PRO (System of Observation and Experimentation for Environmental Research on Organic Residue Recycling). The objectives of QualiAgro are to characterize the agronomic value of urban waste composts and their environmental impacts, in a long-term field trials and related laboratory characterization of the residues. \nThe experimental site (48.90°N and 1.97°E) is located in Feucherolles France (175 m.a.s.l.) with a modified oceanic climate. The soil is a typical Luvisol on loess of the Paris Basin. It has been initiated in 1998 (INRA-Veolia partnership). It is structured as a complete randomized block design (4 replicates, 450m²/plots) on a total surface of 6 ha and include 5 organic treatments: 3 urban composts -   a co-compost of Green Waste and Sludge (GWS), a Biowaste compost (BIOW) and a municipal solid waste compost (MSW) - , 1 reference organic amendment not composted - a farmyard manure (FYM)- and the control -  without organic input. Amendments are applied every 2 years on wheat stubble with an objective of 4 t C ha-1. Additionally, the different treatments received 2 levels of additional mineral nitrogen: low mineral N or optimum mineral N.  The field is managed in conventional wheat-maize rotation.\nSite and plots are equipped for continuous monitoring of meteorological data, soil temperature and humidity. One plot of each treatment is equipped with wick lysimeters at 2 depths (0.45 m and 1 m). At the end of 2014, automatics chambers for N2O and CO2 emission survey will be settled, in order to assess greenhouse gas emissions related to composts and manure use. A Large set of variables mainly including physico-chemical characteristics, are monitored on different compartments of the agro-system (composts, soils, plants, water leaching). For example composts quality, crop yields and grain and crop residues analytical characteristics , main soil analytical characteristics per layer , the  chemical composition of soil solution (collected with  lysimeters), biological communities (microfauna and macrofauned sampling, microbial biomass ) and activities (enzymatic activities, mineralization of organic matter). \nData will be stored in a common database specifically developed for the SOERE PRO network and connected with the other SOERE. \nSoil and plant samples are kept in collection and available for further measurements.",
