 "abstract": "Each site has three common treatments: a control (C), a compacted treatment (T), a compacted and decompacted treatment (D), and more specific ones, locally decompacted soil (P) at Azerailles 54, and, limed (A) and limed and compacted (CA) at Clermont en Argonne 55. Each treatment plot of 0.25ha is replicated three times (3 blocks).\nAzerailles site was installed in spring 2007 and Clermont in spring 2008. Since that time monitoring occured for:\n-mesoclimate: rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, bulk deposition (continuous recording)\n- soil climate: soil moisture (TDR Trase system (5 replicates at 15 and 60 cm depth) in one replicate of C and T (recorded each four hours)\n- water table: 2 piezometers in each replicate of treatments (Divers hourly recorded); monthly sampling using specific devices for Redox problems\n- weakly fixed soil water: cup lysimeters inserted at 15 and 60 cm depth (4 replicates in one block for C and T treatments) + teatments A and CA at Clermont en Argonne. Automate for constant vacuum at 700hP. Monthly collection for chemical analysis\n- soil gas: specific captors installed at 5, 10, 20, 35, 50 and 70 cm depth in each C and T treatments of the 3 blocks in the 2 sites. Monthly collection for chemical analysis (N, CO2, CH4, N2O, O2)\n-soil solid phase: soil morphology, soils physics, chemistry and biology (pro parte) were initialy described. Soil physical parameters (strengh, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, swelling/shrinkage, porosity...), chemistry (C, N, exchangeable cations, P) and biology (earthworms) are perediodicaly investigated (each year for physics; 2/3 years for chemistry and biology).\nvegetation: both understorey and oak plantation were annually observed\nsoil biology: earthworms are periodically observed",
