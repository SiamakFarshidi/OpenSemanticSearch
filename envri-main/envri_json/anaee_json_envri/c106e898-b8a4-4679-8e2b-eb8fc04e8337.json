 "abstract": "UMS BBEES provides the CNRS and the National Museum of Natural History’s research units and researchers with technical and scientific supports to structure, perpetuate or pool their databases. Its interventions result in advices or direct actions during several days to several months in order to relaunch or restructure databases.\nIt benefits the environment in place at the Museum (Service du Patrimoine Naturel, Inventaire national du Patrimoine naturel, collections patrimoniales, Pôle recherche de la DSI, etc). This structure is not designed to administer databases, which remain the responsibility of the teams that produce them, or to provide them with accommodation, which may be the DSI of the Museum or other suitable structure. However, it can provide guidance on these points.\nTo facilitate the integration of databases in national and international frameworks, the UMS BBEES offers recommendations, including:\n- The constitution of corpus and data processing;\n- The choice of tools;\n- Structuring data;\n- Metadata.\nThese recommendations are in line with the operative standards and norms, such as the European Directive INSPIRE (2007/2 / CE of 14 March 2007) for geographical informations, or the choice of a common taxonomic repository for existing biodiversity databases (INPN, GBIF, collections databases).\nThe issue of identification and accessibility of databases is also at the heart of the concerns of the UMS BBEES, particularly the inactive databases (for example databases developed in the framework of national programs and stored on personal computers) and bases on standby (accessible databases, but are not supplied or operated). Investigations are and will be regularly conducted with the directors of research units in order to identify all the databases produced by the units (inactive standby, developing and active), but also to anticipate and accompany the bases of development applications as part of national and international research programs.\nUMS BBEES gave a particular attention to the implementation of regulations concerning intellectual property in the particular field of databases. Thus, it does not facilitate the dissemination of databases that do not comply with legislation.\n ",
