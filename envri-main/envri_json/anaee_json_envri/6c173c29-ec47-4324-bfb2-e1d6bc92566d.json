 "abstract": "This technical platform has been set up to allow ecologists to perform large-scale analysis of environmental DNA via a metabarcoding approach. DNA metabarcoding refers to high throughput DNA-based identification of multiple species from environmental DNA. The main applications consist in diet analysis from feces, in biodiversity assessment using soil or water samples, and in palaeo-environment reconstruction using lake sediments and permafrost samples. \nThe eDNA platform is composed of three pre-PCR extraction rooms dedicated to feces, soil, and ancient DNA, and to several post-PCR rooms dedicated to the purification and the titration of PCR products. The next generation sequencing on Illumina platforms (HiSeq or MiSeq) is outsourced. The eDNA platform also possesses all the equipment that can be transported and installed in the field to allow DNA extraction straight after the sampling. \nThe eDNA platform can provide support to:\n(I) Design the experiment according to the scientfic goal, and ensure data quality given the technical contraints\n(ii) perform large-scale DNA extractions\n(iii) perform large-scale DNA amplifications\n(iv) outsource DNA sequencing to a company having developped protocols ensuring high quality amplicon sequencing from eDNA samples\n(v) analyze raw sequences to produce a contengency table that will be analyzed later on by the prosecutor\n(vi) help discussing the scientific results with regards to the possible pitfalls of the metabarcoding approach",
