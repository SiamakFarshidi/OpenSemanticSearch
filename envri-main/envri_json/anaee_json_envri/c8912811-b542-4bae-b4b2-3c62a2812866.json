 "abstract": "The site of Colmar is part of the French national network SOERE PRO (System of Observation and Experimentation for Environmental Research on Organic Residue Recycling). The objectives of the site of Colmar are to characterize the agronomic value of organic residues and their environmental impacts, in a long-term field experiment.\nIt has been initiated in 2001 (INRA / SMRA68 / ADEME / Agence de l’Eau Rhin-Meuse partnership).\nThe experimental site is located in Colmar (Alsace, France) with a continental climate. The soil is a calcisoil (surface layer: 24% clay, 69% silt, 7% sand / 2.4 % organic matter / pH 8.3). The trial is composed of 60 plots of 90 m² (10 m x 9 m) on 2.2 hectares with 4 replicate blocks of 6 organic treatments randomly distributed within each block: Urban sewage sludge, Composted sewage sludge, Biowaste compost, Farmyard manure, Composted Farmyard manure, Control without organic amendment. The organic amendments are spread every 2 years on the same nitrogen rate of 170 kg/ha. The different treatments received 2 levels of additional mineral fertilizer: without or optimum mineral fertilization. The crops rotation is corn maize / winter wheat / sugar beet / malting barley.\nSite and plots are equipped for continuous monitoring of meteorological data, soil humidity, water tension and temperature. One plot of each treatment is equipped with wick lysimeters to a depth of 0.45 m. Since 2009, six large lysimeters (4m² and 1m deep, bare soil) complete the field experiment, with 2 replicates of 3 organic treatments: Urban sewage sludge, Composted sewage sludge and Control without organic amendment. They are also equipped to measure the hydrodynamic balance: soil humidity, water tension, temperature, volume of leachate.\nA Large set of variables mainly including nutrients and pollutants (trace elements, PAH, PCB), are monitored on different compartments of the agro-system: organic amendments physico-chemical and biochemical characteristics, soils analytical characteristics per layer, crop yields, plants quality, rainwater chemical composition, leachate, microbial biomass and activities.\nData will be stored in a common database specifically developed for the SOERE PRO network and connected with other SOERE.\nSoils, organic amendments and plants samples are kept in collection and available for further measurements.",
