 "abstract": "The SOERE PRO Reunion is one of the experimental sites of SOERE PRO. The site hosts a long-term experiment (2013-2030) for the study of the environmental impact of the recovery of organic waste products (PRO) in annual sugar cane crop (semi-perennial plant) by analyzing the impact spreading of these products of agricultural and urban origin on the quality of the soil, the quality of the plants harvested on the amended soils, the quality of the water circulating in the amended soils and migrating towards the ground or superficial waters, the gaseous emissions.\nThe measuring device is designed to analyze the dynamics of organic matter in soils and the functioning of associated biogeochemical cycles, the fate of organic and metallic trace pollutants brought by organic waste products and the biological and microbiological functioning of soils subject to regular spreading. .\nThe site is located on the island of Reunion, at the Experimental Station of Mare which has a tropical climate with an average temperature of 25 ° C and average rainfall of 2000 mm / year. The soil of the site is of Nitisol type (intensely altered tropical soil). The experiment covers an area of ​​1 ha with a sugar cane crop with an 8-year replanting cycle. This device comprises 5 blocks of 6 parcels. Each plot measures 9m x 27m. Each of the five blocks presents the following treatments: mineral control, agronomic control, Step sludge, compost of Step sludge and green waste (only every 4 years buried during the replanting of the cane or on the surface), hog manure , poultry litter (only every 4 years buried when replanting the cane or on the surface). A plot is also maintained in bare soil with the same different modalities.\nThe site is equipped with lysimetric devices to collect the soil solution, instruments to monitor the water flow in the soil, twelve automated measurement chambers of the gases emitted by the ground, a complete weather station. Soils, PROs brought, plants are sampled every year and kept. The analyzes of major elements and the main traces are systematically carried out.
