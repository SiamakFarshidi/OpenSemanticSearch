 "abstract": "French Guiana is a privileged territory for developing research projects in ecology and environment. The Paracou European Tropical Research Station (P-ETRS) is located about 50km from Kourou. The P-ETRS mixed heterogeneous forest is a typical tropical rainforest ecosystem, with about 180 species per hectare, and 500 trees (DBH > 10 cm) per hectare. \nP-ETRS belongs to a type of experiment set up in the 1980s to study the long-term impact of forest disturbance, particularly forest logging, on the dynamics of natural tropical rainforests. More than 100ha of trees >10cm diameter at breast height were spatialised and monitored inside large plots,  of which 75ha have been followed yearly since 1984. A 55m high self standing eddyflux tower was set up in 2003 and micrometeorological data are recorded since then. Main measurements focus on energy, carbon and water cycles.\nThe Paracou station has one living camp, accessible by road, equipped for science for a few days to several months. Traditional sleeping houses (carbets) are available, as well as electricity, refrigerators and drinking water. Communication with the outside is made by satellite phone and satellite Internet. 35 persons can be accomodated.\nClimate and forest dynamic data are available upon demand.\nCirad is responsible for the Paracou station, excepting the flux tower which belongs to Inra.\nThe Paracou station operates jointly with the Nouragues - European Tropical Research Station (see related spreadsheet).",
