 "abstract": "Permanent Grassland Site of Theix-Laqueuille is a part of the SOERE ACBB that is a System of Observation and Experimentation for Environmental Research on Agroecosystems, Biochemical Cycles and Biodiversity.\nPermanent Grassland Site of Theix-Laqueuille consists in a long-term experiment set up under semi-natural upland permanent grassland in the Massif Central, France (850 to 1040 m.a.s.l, semi-continental climate), which aims to analyse the relationship between management practices, community dynamics and ecosystem properties and services.\nThe main goals are to monitor the long term impacts of grassland management on biodiversity and biochemical cycles and to provide an instrumented experimental plateform in order to analyse ecosystem functioning and processes.\nThe experimental treatments are applied since 2005 in a well replicated design in Theix with four repetitions per treatment on 400 to 2200 m² plots and since 2002 on two large plots (3 ha) in Laqueuille, in order to analyse the effects of the two mains management factors which are driving the ecosystem, i.e., the level of disturbance and the level of nutrient availability. Continuous grazing at high and low cattle stocking rate are applied in Laqueuille. In Theix, two contrasting levels of herbage use are compared without N fertiliser by manipulating stocking density (sheep and cattle grazing) with a control in abandon. Further comparison between grazing and cutting are obtained by including mown plots at three contrasting levels of inorganic fertiliser supply.\nSite and plots are equipped for continuous monitoring of meteorological data, soil temperature and humidity. Regular measurements concern a large set of variables: aboveground plant production, quality and nutrient content, soil solution chemical composition (ceramic cups), main soil state variables per layer, state of diversity for plant, earthworms and microbe communities. Both large paddocks are equipped with an eddy covariance flux towers according to ICOS standard for H2O, CO2 and CH4 fluxes measurements, and with automatics chambers for N2O emission, that allow to assess greenhouse gas balance and C sequestration according to grazing management.\nData are stored in common database developed for SOERE ACBB.\nSoil and plant samples are kept in collection and available for further determinations.\nWith yet 10 years of data, the site devoted to studying the long term development of the soil-vegetation systems of grassland under contrasting management regimes gives the oppportunity to stongly integrate discilinary research on vegetation dynamics, soil biology, soil physics and chemistry and sward-herbivore interactions.",
