 "abstract": "Data obtained from the INRA CARRTEL laboratory in Thonon-les-Bains (SOERE-OLA: Observation and Experimental Systems for Environmental Research - LAke Observatory) in collaboration with SILA (Intercommunal Syndicate of Lake Annecy) Manager of the lake. These data cover different topics:\n   The variables of the physico-chemistry theme are: nitrogen, calcium, carbon, chlorides, conductivity, magnesium, dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphorus, potassium, reactive silica, sodium, sulphate, temperature, complete alkalimetric titre. Data taken at various depths throughout the lake's water column. The water column is made at the deepest point of the lake (65m). The samples are taken every 15 days. Without being continuous the period concerns a follow-up from the years 1965 to the present day (Absence of data between 1982 and May 1990).\n   The variables of the chlorophyll theme are: chlorophyll a strickland-parsons, chlorophyll c, carotenoids, chlorophyll a scor-unesco, pheopigments.\n   The variables of the topic sampling conditions are: air temperature, cloudiness, sunshine, weather, wind direction, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, water aspect, surface condition, transparency, color of water.\n   The variables of the phytoplankton theme are: determiner name, sedimented volume, counting surface, determined taxon, number of counted fields, number of objects counted, number of objects per ml, number of cells per ml, biovolume of species In the sample.\n   The variables of the primary production theme are: duration of incubation, primary production by actual incubation duration, primary production per hour, primary production by median third.\n   The variables of the probe theme are: depth, temperature, chlorophyll a, pH conductivity, oxygen, oxygen saturation rate, turbidity, transparency, by w, by a, pc.\n   The variables of the zooplankton theme are: name of the determiner, sedimented biovolume, name of the taxon determined, stage of development, number of individuals.",
