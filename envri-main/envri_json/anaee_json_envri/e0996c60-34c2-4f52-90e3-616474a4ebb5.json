 "abstract": "This service will provide four shared instrumental devices to follow in real time  the CO2, N2O and CH4 soil efflux and vertical concentration profile as well as their isotopic signature (13C, 15N). These instrumental devices will be installed in ecosystem experimental sites (e.g. SOERE FORET & ACBB). The data set collected will be completed by measurements of soil and meteorological conditions and net ecosystem fluxes (CO2, H2O, N2O CH4) determined from eddy covariance systems data. To do so, we will setup four trailers housing each a cavity ring-down spectroscopy analyser (Aerodyn, Picarro), coupled with selection-sampling systems, and then able to measure continuously CO2, H2O and CH4, N2O, as well as stable isotopes (13C, 15N) at 8 sample points. Mobile trailers will move from one site to the other by a car, they are ventilated and may be used under field and lab conditions throughout the year. The CRDS technique provides high sensitivity, speed, and selectivity. It can be configured to measure two or three gases simultaneously (i.e. measure intervals of 10sec with precision 0.3 and 0.8 permill). Data acquisition systems will collect data and pilot the selection-sampling systems. Satellite connection allows instrument and data control (and alarm) from a distance, as well as data downloads. During one campaign on one site, the measurements will provide data with high quality to estimate temporal evolution of isotopic signature of the soil efflux and soil layers production.",
