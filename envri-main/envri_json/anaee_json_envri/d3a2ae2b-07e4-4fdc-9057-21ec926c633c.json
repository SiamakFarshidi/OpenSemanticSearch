 "abstract": "Data obtained from the INRA CARRTEL laboratory in Thonon-les-Bains (SOERE-OLA: Observatory and Experimentation Systems for Environmental Research - LAkes Observatory) in collaboration with the SMALA (Syndicat Mixte d'Aménagement du Lac d ' Aiguebelette) and the Community of Communes of Lake d'Aiguebelette (CCLA). These data cover different topics:\n   The variables of the physico-chemistry theme are: nitrogen, calcium, carbon, chlorides, conductivity, magnesium, dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphorus, potassium, reactive silica, sodium, sulphate, temperature, complete alkalimetric titre. Data taken at various depths throughout the lake's water column. The samples are taken every 15 days. The period concerns a follow-up from 1974 to the present.\n   The variables of the chlorophyll theme are: chlorophyll a strickland-parsons, chlorophyll c, carotenoids, chlorophyll a scor-unesco, pheopigments. Data taken at various depths throughout the lake's water column. The samples are taken one to three times a month. The period concerns a follow-up from 1989 to the present.\n   The variables of the topic sampling conditions are: air temperature, cloudiness, sunshine, weather, wind direction, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, water aspect, surface condition, transparency, color of water. Studies are carried out approximately once or twice a month. The period concerns a follow-up from 1974 to the present.\n   The variables of the phytoplankton theme are: determiner name, sedimented volume, counting surface, determined taxon, number of counted fields, number of objects counted, number of objects per ml, number of cells per ml, biovolume of species In the sample. Data taken from an integrated depth of 0 to 10m or 0 to 20m depending on the year. Samples are taken once a month. The period concerns a follow-up from 1998 to the present.\n   The variables of the primary production theme are: duration of incubation, primary production by actual incubation duration, primary production per hour, primary production by median third. Data taken at various depths on the lake's water column from 0 to 30m. The samples are taken once or twice a month. The period concerns a follow-up from 2011 to the present.\n   The variables of the probe theme are: depth, temperature, chlorophyll a, pH conductivity, oxygen, oxygen saturation rate, turbidity, transparency, by w, by a, pah, pc. Data obtained at various depths (every 10 cm approximately) over the whole water column of the lake (0 to 68 m). Measurements are performed once or twice a month. The period concerns a follow-up from 1974 to the present.",
