 "abstract": "The EcogenO platform, specialised in environmental genomics, offers original thinking and promotes the transfer of knowledge and expertise in the field.\n\nThis platform enables projects for large-scale amplicon production and their analysis by sequencing, as well as RNASeq, ChipSeq or DNASeq projects.\n\nEquipped with 2nd generation NGS sequencers (Illumina) and a large number of satellite equipment required for sample preparation, the EcogenO platform offers the implementation and support of sequencing projects, from library preparation to primary bioinformatics data analysis.\n\nIn addition, the presence on the EcogenO platform of very high throughput quantitative PCR and genotyping equipment, unique in France (Smartchip system, Takara), offers the scientific community a capacity for project management for functional analyses (qPCR and RT-qPCR, dPCR) and SNP genotyping.\n\nEcogenO has a large storage and analysis capacity for SNP data, enabling the development of bioinformatics analyses, specific to a project or an application in a collaborative mode.\nThe scientific community can apply for an access to some of this equipment, after training and accreditation by the staff.",
