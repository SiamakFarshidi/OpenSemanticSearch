 "abstract": "The site of EFELE (Effluents d’Elevage et Environnement) is part of the french network labeled as SOERE PRO. The objectives of EFELE are the same as QualiAgro and Colmar sites : the aim of the project is to characterize the long term effects of organic products applications on soil properties and to quantify their effects on water and air quality. \nThe experimental site was initiated in 2012 and is located in Brittany, at Le Rheu. The soil is a loamy soil (neoluvisol  à luvisol/redoxisol). The field is managed with a maize/ wheat crop rotation, and white mustard is sown after the wheat  to cover the soil during the intercropping period. \nTwo trials are studied at EFELE site :  \n-\tA first trial named « PROs » is structured as a complete randomized block design with 4 replicates. The effects of 5 typical animal wastes are compared to control treatments : i) cattle farmyard manure and composted pig manure are applied every 2 years before maize sowing, and ii) layers manure, pig slurry and a digestate obtained after pig slurry digestion are applied in spring, on wheat vegetation at early spring or just before maize sowing. The rates of application range from 50 t ha-1 for cattle manure, 25 t ha-1 for composted pig manure, 20-25 t ha-1 for the slurry and the digestate and 3 t ha-1 for layers manure, \n-\tA second trial named « TS/MO »  is structured as a band trial with 3 replicates. The objectives of this trial are to study the effects of cattle farmyard manure on soil properties under conventional tillage and reduced tillage. \nThe meteorological data are monitored on the site, and 7 experimental plots are equipped with TDR probes (TRASE system), tensiometers (UMS T4e) and temperature probes placed at the depth of 13, 40, 60, 80 and 110 cm. Data are collected at a hourly time step. 10 plots are also equipped with wick lysimeters (0.25 x 0.50 m) placed at the depth of 40 and 90 cm. \nThe monitoring of N2O and CO2 emission is done by a set of 6 automatics chambers.\nThe soil surface layer (0-25 cm) is sampled every year before the animal wastes application, to characterize the evolution of the physical, biological and chemical properties. \nSoil, plant and animal wastes samples are kept in collection.",
