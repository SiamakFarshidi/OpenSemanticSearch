 "abstract": "With this innovative platform we will be able to bring the laboratory to the field (rather than report samples to the laboratory with all that that implies as disruption and transformation between the in situ sampling and laboratory analysis). It is composed of a number of complimentary and innovative kits (soil,vegetation, micro climate, microbiology..). Each kit contains mobile state of the art equipement able to fullfill a great number of analytic and monitoring tasks..\nIt will aim:\n(i) to characterize environmentally terrestrial ecosystems (especially sites non-instrumented but with great potential to generalize the results obtained on the three nodes of the project (eg experimental devices GIS Data Cooperative - or provenance trials - eg Plantacomp) - the platform will be a major-waiting for inter-study ecosystems (forests, grasslands, crops);\n(ii) allow campaigns targeted measures at highly instrumented monitoring sites or at other representative sites(instantaneous flow capture special events, unstable compounds)\n(iii) serve as a support for the development of measures in situ and non-destructive analytic techniques and methods. (soil, vegetation….)\nOverall, this platform is a facility open acces, usuable by the entire community of environmental sciencists.",
