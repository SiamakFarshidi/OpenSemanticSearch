 "abstract": "The data collection of the North Sea is divided in two datasets : the discrete collection and the trajectories collection.\n\nThe Discrete SeaDataCloud Temperature and Salinity Historical Data Collection for the North Sea includes open access in situ data on temperature and salinity measured with â€œdiscreteâ€ instruments (CTD, XBT, discrete water samplersâ€¦). The data span between 4Â°W and 10Â°E in longitude, and from 49Â°N to 62Â°N in latitude. It covers the time period 1893 â€“ 2017. The data were retrieved from the SeaDataNet infrastructure in November 2017. \nThe â€œTrajectoriesâ€ SeaDataCloud Temperature and Salinity Historical Data Collection for the North Sea includes open access in situ data on temperature and salinity measured by continuously recording sensors (e.g. Ferryboxes). The data span between 4Â°W and 10Â°E in longitude, and from 49Â°N to 62Â°N in latitude. It covers the time period 1989 â€“ 2017. \n\nThe data were retrieved from the SeaDataNet infrastructure in November 2017. The quality control of the data has been performed with the help of ODV software. Data Quality Flags have been revised following common recommended procedures defined under SeaDataNet 2 project in conjunction with visual expert check. \n\nThe dataset format is ODV binary collections. You can read, analyse and export from the ODV application provided by Alfred Wegener institute at http://odv.awi.de/.\n\nFor data access please register at http://www.marine-id.org/.",
